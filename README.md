# Ask me App

Online dictionary and image search by user-entered word.
This React App is part of my final work in SheCodes React sertification, and is made in practise purpose.
It gave me good groundings of React functionalities, such as props, states etc. Its connected in:

- Dictionary api https://dictionaryapi.dev
- Pexels image api https://www.pexels.com/api/

Dictionary api is still unfortunately little
inadequate compared in pexels image api, so often we get no results but images.
I still need to improve this.

```
basic npm commands, nothing special with this
```
